SISSI-II-Local Bubble
=====================

Jupyter Notebook with Julia code for reproducing analysis outlined in my 2025 paper "SISSI II: The new age of the Local Bubble".   

## Requirements

Julia is required.   
A manifest file is provided to ensure that the identical environment can be used.   
Dataset from Edenhofer et al. 2024 is required: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8187943

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/leonardromano/SISSI-II-Local-Bubble.git

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook and recreate the environment by executing the first two lines of the notebook.

## Usage

Start the Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells line by line.
Be aware that due to the large size of the datasets some operations might be quite computationally expensive and require generous ressource allocations (>200 GB RAM).
